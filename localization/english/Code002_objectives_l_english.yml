 SIOU_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Sioux are made up of three tribes living in different regions, Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota, who have their own Sioux dialects, and the names of all three tribes mean "friends" in the Sioux language. The Sioux lived in the Great Plains region of the western United States and lived primarily by hunting. They were highly skilled in horsemanship and were known for their ability to shoot arrows and shoot guns accurately while riding fast horses. They are also proficient in breeding horses and have many smart horses that run very fast. Some warriors even raised hundreds of horses."
 IROQ_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Iroquois tribes formed the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in the northern region of New York, becoming the most powerful indigenous force in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. The Confederacy reached its peak in the late 17th century, with its territory stretching from the Chesapeake Bay to the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers in the east-west direction, and from Kentucky to Ontario in the north-south direction. Many of their achievements are remarkable, including the establishment of a political system characterized by checks and balances. The central tenet of Haudenosaunee law was that member tribes would never wage war against each other. When facing external enemies, their united political and military power was often invincible."
 CHEY_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The name "Cheyenne" originates from the Sioux term "Sahiyenan," which means "people who speak a different language." The Cheyenne people refer to themselves as "Tsitsistas," which simply means "the people." In fact, many Native American tribal names carry this same meaning. Originally, the Cheyenne were an agricultural society, but after the United States implemented its westward expansion policies, they were forced to relocate to the Great Plains. There, they adopted a lifestyle similar to the Sioux, relying on bison hunting for survival. The Cheyenne were exceptional horsemen, and unlike most other tribes, both men and women participated in bison hunts, showcasing their unique cultural practices."
 COMA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Comanche were originally a branch of the Shoshone tribe. After acquiring horses in the late 17th century, they began migrating southwest, becoming a distinct tribe and gradually gaining control over a vast region stretching from western Oklahoma, across the Texas plains, to New Mexico. This area came to be known as "Comancheria." They later became renowned as expert horsemen of the southern plains, skilled in the use of lances, bows, and arrows. Hunting bison on horseback provided the Comanche with a stable food source, leading to a steady increase in their population. They also bred and captured horses, causing their herds to grow significantly over time."
 APAC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Apache deeply loved the lands of the Southwest and lamented their confinement to reservations. Geronimo, the most famous of all Apache, wrote of his love for the lands of his youth in his biography. “There is no climate or soil which, to my mind, is equal to that of Arizona... It is my land, my home, my fathers' land, to which I now ask to be allowed to return.”"
 NEZP_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Nez Perce, also known as the Navajo, primarily inhabit parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah in the southwestern United States. They boast a rich cultural heritage, particularly renowned for their weaving and beadwork. Historically, the Nez Perce have endured numerous conflicts and relocations with the U.S. government, the most famous being the "Long Walk," during which the U.S. government forcibly removed approximately 8,000 Nez Perce from their homeland to a concentration camp called Fort Sumner in an effort to control their lands. About 200 to 300 people died during the journey."
 AZTE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Aztecs were known for their fierce and relentless combat skills, as well as their sophisticated diplomatic strategies, often capturing enemies to be used as live sacrifices in religious ceremonies. Their society was built on a foundation of complex and advanced agricultural techniques, and the world's knowledge of foods such as tomatoes, corn, cocoa, and chili peppers comes from them. They were constrained by the lack of large domestic animals like horses or cattle, relying solely on human strength to transport all goods. Despite their large population and formidable combat capabilities, the Aztecs could not withstand the Spanish conquistadors for long, a situation greatly exacerbated by the infectious diseases brought by the Europeans on their ships."
 INCA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Inca Empire's territory stretched thousands of miles across undulating mountain ranges, from Ecuador along the coast of Peru to southern Chile. When the Spanish explorer Francisco Pizarro arrived in the Inca Empire, it had just resolved a civil war between two brothers. The new emperor underestimated Pizarro's strength and was captured by him. He agreed to give Pizarro a large amount of gold and silver as ransom, but Pizarro, after receiving the treasure, broke his promise and killed the Inca emperor. After a brutal battle, the Inca Empire quickly declined."
 MAY_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Maya civilization emerged from the Yucatán Peninsula, where the cultivation of crops such as corn, beans, and squash, along with improvements in irrigation techniques, spurred population growth. The Maya built magnificent and splendid cities, with advanced developments in writing, astronomy, and mathematics. They established a complex political system of competing city-states and a ballgame known as the Mesoamerican ballgame. The Maya were capable of accurately measuring the orbital periods of planets. They cyclically constructed buildings, demolished them, and then rebuilt new structures on the original foundations. After the decline of the Maya civilization, their grand cities were gradually engulfed by the tropical jungle."
 SML_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The term "Seminole" is said to originate from the Spanish word for "wild man." They were originally a branch of the Creek tribe from Georgia and migrated to Florida in the 18th century. They sought to live in areas loosely governed by the Spanish, staying as far away as possible from the expanding British colonies. Northern Florida also served as a refuge for escaped slaves, who then formed an alliance with the Seminole people. However, both British colonists and Americans invaded Florida to seize land and capture escaped slaves. Despite these incursions, the Seminole were adept at disappearing into the swamps and setting up well-planned ambushes."
 CREE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Cree people lived in the woodlands of James Bay, Quebec, and gradually expanded westward, eventually occupying lands stretching from Quebec across the Great Plains to the mountains near the Pacific Ocean. Both the British and the French came to trade furs with the Cree. They also sold guns to the Blackfoot in exchange for horses, which were essential for thriving on the Great Plains. By the 19th century, the Cree population had significantly declined. This was partly due to diseases, particularly smallpox, and partly because other tribes, fleeing the advancing white settlers along the Missouri River, moved north and engaged in continuous warfare with the Cree."
 PATA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Mapuche originally inhabited what is now Argentina and Chile. In addition to hunting and gathering, they also cultivated crops such as potatoes on small plots of land for sustenance. During times of war, the Mapuche would unite and elect a "Toqui" as their leader. The Spanish initially believed they could easily conquer the Mapuche and their lands. However, the Mapuche were adept at using axes to counterattack the Spanish. After more than a century of warfare, the Spanish finally conceded defeat and signed a treaty with the Mapuche, agreeing to cease their attempts to seize their lands."
 PAIU_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Paiute people are primarily distributed across the western United States, particularly in Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona, and some adjacent areas. Their livelihood largely depended on hunting and gathering, but they also engaged in some cultivation of crops such as corn, beans, and squash. The Paiute were skilled in using bows and arrows, as well as traps, to hunt animals like deer, rabbits, and wild birds. Their culture places significant importance on dance, music, and storytelling, with a strong emphasis on their relationship with nature and the worship of deities. As the United States expanded, the Paiute began to face pressure from the U.S. government."
 AMZ_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Ed Stafford, a former British Army captain stationed in Afghanistan, is a television presenter, explorer, and adventurer who holds a Guinness World Record for being the first person to walk the entire length of the Amazon River. By a stroke of fate, he became the chief of a tribe. Leveraging his extensive survival knowledge, ecological restoration skills, and profound understanding of nature, he quickly earned the tribe's respect. Under his leadership, the tribe gradually began to utilize the resources of the Amazon rainforest to develop trade and agriculture."
