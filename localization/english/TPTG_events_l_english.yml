 je_taiping_land_socializationicon: "Taiping Land Socializationicon"
 je_taiping_land_socializationicon_reason: "China has always been a large country based on agriculture, with the vast majority of the population living in agriculture, and the land issue of peasants is an important issue. How well this problem is resolved has a bearing on the rise and fall of political power, the control of chaos, and the prosperity and decline of the social economy."
 je_taiping_land_policy: "The Land System of the Heavenly Kingdom"
 je_taiping_land_policy_reason: "According to the principle of "where the world is in the field, the people in the world plough together", each mu of land is divided into upper, middle, and lower levels according to the annual output, and then the good and bad fields are matched with each other, and the good and bad fields are evenly distributed according to the population. All men and women over the age of 16 are given an equal amount of land each, and those under the age of 15 are given half of the land. At the same time, it also put forward the method of "connecting abundance and famine" and relieving famine with abundance."

 Code002_TPG_events.1.d: "Amid escalating tensions between Hong Xiuquan and Yang Xiuqing, the Heavenly Father delivered His divine will to all believers through a collective dream. In the vision, He rebuked the followers for abandoning the Heavenly Kingdom's sacred mission due to selfish desires and inflicted punishment—agonizing headaches and convulsions that left them writhing on the ground."
 Code002_TPG_events.1.f: "After the punishment, Hong Xiuquan and Yang Xiuqing led everyone to kneel in front of the Heavenly Father, swearing to put their personal grievances under their faith, unite as one, and build Heaven into a paradise on earth."
 Code002_TPG_events.1.a: "The light of the Father shines on this land."
 Je_TPG_Divided_01_modifier: "The Will of the Heavenly Father"

 Code002_TPG_events.2.t: "The Tianjing Incident"
 Code002_TPG_events.2.d: "Yang Xiuqing used the urgency of the western front as an excuse to transfer Wei Changhui and Shi Da to the front line to supervise the division, leaving only the Heavenly King and the Eastern King to stay in Tianjing. Chen Chengying told the king of heaven, saying that the king of the east had an attempt to kill the king and usurp the throne, and Hong Xiuquan secretly ordered Wei Changhui, Shi Dakai, and Qin Rigang to eradicate Yang Xiuqing. Wei Changhui led 3,000 elite troops back to Tianjing, joined Qin Rigang outside the city that night, and raided the Dongwang Mansion in the early morning, killing Yang Xiuqing and his supporters. Later, Wei Changhui killed dissidents in the name of searching for the "Eastern Party" and washed Tianjing in blood."
 Code002_TPG_events.2.f: "Shi Dakai went to Tianjing more than ten days later, entered the city to meet Wei Changhui, reproached the indiscriminate killing, broke up unhappily, and fled out of the city in a hurry overnight. Wei Changhui failed to arrest Shi Dakai and killed his family and royal subordinates. Shi Dakai raised troops from Anqing to attack Wei Changhui, begging the king to kill Wei Changhui to thank the world. At this time, most of the Taiping troops outside Tianjing supported Shi Dakai, and Wei Changhui attacked the Tianwang Mansion in a hurry, but was finally defeated by the soldiers loyal to the Tianwang and the remnants of Yang Xiuqing, and his head was sent to Shi Dakai's camp for acceptance, and Qin Rigang and Chen Chengying were also executed soon after, and the Tianjing Incident came to an end. Later, the Heavenly King revoked Yang Xiuqing's charge of plotting to usurp the throne, and set Yang's death as the "Eastern King's Ascension Festival".\n\nThe sword light and blood light were intertwined, and the believers of the past could no longer understand the will of the Heavenly Father, and the glory of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was cast a bloody shadow from then on."

 Code002_TPG_events.3.d: "After years of drift, [SCOPE.sCharacter('Hong_Rengan_scope').GetFullName] finally returned to Tianjing amidst the turbulence of the Taiping Rebellion. A polymath versed in both Chinese and Western learning, he brought back extensive knowledge of Western political systems, economic models, and military technologies. At the royal court, he presented a comprehensive reform agenda advocating centralized authority, industrial development, and military modernization to consolidate the Heavenly Kingdom's rule."
 Code002_TPG_events.3.f: "Hong Rengan's return, however, sparked intense controversy. Conservative ministers argued that his proposals deviated from the will of the Heavenly Father and risked undermining the religious authority of the Heavenly Kingdom. At this critical juncture, the Heavenly King faced a pivotal decision: whether to adopt Hong Rengan's reforms and steer the Heavenly Kingdom onto a path of modernization."
 Code002_TPG_events.3.a: "He was enfeoffed as Gan King and entrusted with overseeing all governmental affairs of the realm."

 je_new_administrative_paper_02_reason: "Develop industry and commerce, encourage free trade, introduce advanced Western technology, and establish a national bank to stabilize the monetary system. At the same time, the Heavenly Kingdom should implement a fair taxation system, eliminate excessive levies and arbitrary taxes to alleviate the burden on the people, ensure a prosperous treasury, and lay the foundation for the nation's long-term development."
 je_new_administrative_paper_03: "New Administrative Paper: Society"
 je_new_administrative_paper_03_reason: "Abolish outdated customs, improve the status of women, promote literacy for all, establish schools to spread modern education, and develop healthcare and social welfare systems.

Golden wheat fields swayed in unison with straw-hatted farmers, while markets pulsed with commercial vitality. The laughter of children echoed through schoolyards liberated by universal education. Along coastlines guarded by granite fortresses, coal-smoke plumes from ironclads twisted into protective sigils against the crimson dawn."

 Code002_TPG_events.5.t: "Heavenly Father descended to earth"
 Code002_TPG_events.5.d: "After the council, Yang Xiuqing abruptly feigned possession by the Heavenly Father, rebuking Hong Xiuquan: 'Your Lord, the Heavenly King, possesses an overly harsh temperament... To rule the world, one must govern with leniency. Consider the female officials who assist in divine affairs at the Celestial Court—many lack understanding of heavenly principles and often act improperly. You must patiently instruct them and show magnanimity, winning their willing obedience so that divine affairs may be properly managed. Excessive severity only breeds confusion; they will not know how to act to fulfill your will.'"
 Code002_TPG_events.5.f: "This 'divine edict' was relayed by Wei Changhui to the Heavenly King. Yang Xiuqing then proceeded to the Heavenly King’s Palace, demanding of Hong Xiuquan: 'Do you acknowledge your wrongdoing?' Hong admitted fault. Acting as the Heavenly Father’s vessel, Yang decreed: ‘Since you admit guilt, you shall receive forty lashes!’ Officials pleaded to bear the punishment in his stead, but Yang refused. With no alternative, Hong Xiuquan obeyed, prostrating himself to receive the lashes. Yang then declared: ‘Since you have submitted to the decree, I shall spare you the rod!’ With that, the Heavenly Father ‘ascended back to heaven.’"
