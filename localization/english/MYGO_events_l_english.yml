 je_crychic_dissolved: "CRYCHIC"
 je_crychic_dissolved_reason: ""Sakiko, that's great, you finally came. You're completely soaked, are you okay? You didn't come to school for classes and haven't replied to any messages."\n\n"I came here today to tell you something, I want to quit CRYCHIC."\n\n"Wait a minute, sit down first and then tell me, okay?"\n\nShakes head~\n\n"Why? Did something happen? Can't you tell us? Or is it something we caused? If there's a problem, we can fix it."\n\n"It's my own problem."\n\n"Why? Wasn't the last performance really fun? You even said you wanted to continue, right?"\n\n"I never said that."\n\n"Is... that so? But, you're the one who started CRYCHIC. If you quit, then...""

 mygo_events.1.t: "The Disbandment of CRYCHIC"
 mygo_events.1.d: ""Are you really... going to quit?"\n"Tomori is asking you a question, and this is so irresponsible, right?... Why aren’t you saying anything?"\n"Taki, stop it."\n"Well, if you're going to quit, don’t cause us more trouble. Today, everyone was waiting for Sakiko."\n"Taki!"\n"Even if I’m not here, you all can practice, right? If you want to practice, you can practice on your own. There’s no rule that says everyone has to be here for practice, don’t blame others."\n"But, if you're going to quit..."\n"Stop saying things like that, Tomori. You’re the one who needs practice the most. But what have you been doing until now?"\n"Tomori has been waiting for you to come!""
 mygo_events.1.f: ""Wait a moment, let's calm down and talk, okay?\n"We've all been playing in the band together and having fun for so long, Mutsumi also thinks this way, right?"\n"I... have never felt happy playing in the band.""
 mygo_events.1.a: "Parted unhappily..."
 
 je_universal_education: "Don't Want to Fail Again"
 je_universal_education_reason: "My name is...\nAnon...\nWait. I'm so crazy!\nTeacher!\nTeacher! wait!\nWait! ehh...\nMe...\nMe name...\nMy name is...\nAnon...\nChihaya...\nYESU!\nWait, I'm wrong?\nTeacher!\n..."
 
 mygo_events.2.t: "Entrance Interview"
 mygo_events.2.d: ""Hey..."\n"Hey..."\n"Let's go back."\nChihaya Anon, unable to adjust to life and studies in the UK, decided to return to her home country."
 mygo_events.2.f: ""Did you serve as the student council president in middle school?"\n"Yes, and at this school, I also want to actively participate in activities and have a fulfilling high school life."\n"Very thoughtful, thank you for your answer. The interview ends here."\n"Okay, thank you."\n\nThe interview went pretty well, and the overall evaluation from middle school is also good, so admission shouldn't be a problem."
 mygo_events.2.a: "I want to start over here!"

 je_mysterious_girlicon: "Mysterious Girl of Hake Hill"
 je_mysterious_girlicon_reason: "Tomori has a hobby of collecting objects since he was a child, and once scared his friends because he collected a bunch of watermelon worms. \n\nA week before Golden Week, when collecting stones in flower beds..."

 mygo_events.3.t: "The Movements in the Flower Bed"
 mygo_events.3.d: "After the entrance interview ended, Anon saw Tomori collecting stones in the flower bed."
 mygo_events.3.f: ""Did you drop something?"\n\nTomori looked up and saw Anon. In her flustered state, a few stones fell out of her pocket. She hurriedly picked them up, hesitated for a moment as she stood up, then nodded at Anon before quickly fleeing the scene."
 mygo_events.3.a: "？？？..."

 mygo_events.4.t: "Admitted Smoothly"
 mygo_events.4.d: ""Although Golden Week is just around the corner, today a new student has joined our class."\n"My name is Chihaya Anon. Due to family reasons, I enrolled at this unusual time. I hope everyone will be willing to be my friend. Please take care of me."\nApplause...\n"Chihaya-san, you can take the seat at the back."\n"Okay.""
 mygo_events.4.f: "As Anon walked to the back of the classroom, she noticed the strange girl she had met after the entrance interview. The girl was now taking stones out of a box and placing them on the desk. Anon's pause caught her attention."
 mygo_events.4.a: "Ignore her."
 mygo_events.4.b: "Hahaha, please take care of me."
 mygo_events_4_tt: "Anon, I am Takamatsu Tomori. Please take care of me..."

 je_sound_of_sugar: "Sound of Sugar"
 je_sound_of_sugar_reason: "Anon often lets out laughter that makes her seem a bit silly. If someone could put a piece of candy in her mouth right before she laughs, it might help ease her condition."
 
 mygo_events.5.t: "Lunch Break"
 mygo_events.5.d: "#v "Oh no, lunch break is here. Who should I try to befriend?" #!\n"Tomori, are you going to the Astronomy Club again?"\n"Yeah."\n"Be careful on the way."\n#v They seem like they're easy to get along with. #!"
 mygo_events.5.f: ""Excuse me... can I eat with you?"\n"Sure, let's eat together."\n"Thank you!"\n"Chihaya is such a cute name, like a nickname."\n"Is it cute?"\n"Yes, it's really cute. How did people call you at your previous school?"\n#v Anon recalled that her classmates always called her Chihaya, never Anon. #!\n"You can just call me by my first name."\n"Then I'll call you Anon."\n"Anon is cute too."\n"Do you know Tomori? You two talked this morning, right?"\n"No, no, I just happened to see her picking up stones earlier."\n"She occasionally picks up random things."\n"That's so like Hake Hill's little cute girl. She gives off this small animal vibe. So cute."\n#v Has my topic ended already? #!"
 mygo_events.5.a: "I agree, so cute. Hahaha."
 
 mygo_events.6.t: "After School"
 mygo_events.6.d: ""Let's go home together."\n"Yeah, let's go."\n"Are you in a band?"\n"Yeah, although we just started playing."\n"Seems like everyone is in a band?"\n"There are a lot of people who play bands in our school, because there are senior sisters who have formed a very powerful band."\n"Looks like everyone is forming bands."\n"Tomori probably isn’t in a band. What about you, Anon?""
 mygo_events.6.f: ""I've played a bit."\n"I see. What instrument do you play?"\n"Well, I guess I play guitar and also sing."\n"Me too, me too."\n"If you don't mind, how about we play together? We're looking for a guitarist."\n#v Guitar? So that means... standing in the corner. #!"
 mygo_events.6.a: "Thank you, I'll think about it first."
 mygo_events.6.b: "Is it really okay?"
 
 mygo_events.7.t: "Girl With the Flaxen Hair"
 mygo_events.7.d: "Anon had the idea of forming a band and was looking at the band recruitment notices on the bulletin board downstairs in the classroom building when she was drawn in by a pleasant piano sound."
 mygo_events.7.f: ""You play so well."\n"Are you a member of the brass band?"\n"No, I just came to listen to you play the piano. By the way, would you like to join a band?"\n"..."\n"Sorry for the sudden invitation. I'm Chihaya from Class 1-A."\n"Chihaya-san?"\n"Just call me Anon. I'm looking for band members. I'm the guitarist and vocalist. Would you like to be the keyboardist?"\n"No, thanks."\n"Do you already have a band?"\n"No... the brass band's practice time is almost here. It might be better for you to leave soon.""
 mygo_events.7.a: "It might be better for you to leave soon?"
 
 je_source_of_misfortune: "Source of Misfortune"
 je_source_of_misfortune_reason: "Anyone who comes into contact with Togawa Sakiko will become unlucky. She is like a foul, stinky swamp, pulling people in, trapping them with no escape, no breath. What's even more terrifying is that those trapped in her gravitational field are completely unaware that they are carrying the weight as they move forward."
 je_source_of_misfortune_goal: "The following must be true for 5 years total:"
